      "Wife arrives home around 2pm. Movie starts at 6:30pm and decided we eat before the movies. We mutually agreed we leave at 4pm. So I told her take your time to get ready. So she did, and I stopped and asked, ‚Äúhey so can you shave down there )‚Äù. Wife was like ‚ÄúI got you )‚Äù. I have time to kill. So I decided to hop on my PC and log onto a Squad server to kill time, no kids, I could game in peace. Not even 5 minutes go by- I hear a ‚Äúshit! Of fuck!‚Äù, 30 sec go by and I hear my name being called for help. I wait a few seconds, and she yells my name again. Our bathroom is directly in front of our bedroom, I quickly get up in frustration. Open the bathroom, I see water spewing everywhere! I‚Äôm like wtf! She points under the toilet. I see the pipe that sends water to the toilet bowl spraying water. I quickly try to shut off the rusty valve that was impossible to turn from all the corrosion, I run to the garage to grab a tool for leverage. Like I mentioned earlier the ‚Äúlandlord special‚Äù- there is a copper hardline about 8‚Äù from the water outlet to the bottom of toilet bowl. A grommet at each end creates the seal. \n",

      "You see my wife, thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to kick her leg up on the toilet bowl‚Ä¶. You get the picture. Since there is a copper hardline instead of a normal flex pipe, it shifted and ruptured the seal from the grommet. Our bathroom got semi-flooded and gallons of water spilled from the toilet bowl. 3 trips between Lowe‚Äôs and Home Depot of course we could not find a flex pipe that fits on that ancient water valve. It measured 3/4‚Äù and we did find exactly that, but it would not thread on! 3 hours later, I said screw it- I mcguivered a make shift grommet to re-use the copper line. It worked. We missed our movie, and we‚Äôll just went straight to dinner. Fun night!\n",
